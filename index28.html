The criteria are different for every engine, but all engines share several commonalities. It all boils down to the type and amount of content provided on a given website, the level of optimization done on the site, and the popularity of the website (link popularity/PageRank).

It's rare these days that you'll rank well without at least a few inbound links (although this can happen with the right exact match domain name). A <a href='http://seohull.strikingly.com/blog/focus-on-performance-user-experience-and-scraping'>canonical</a> URL, sometimes <a href='http://prometheus.ikaduchi.com/Adjust-your-appearance-in-search-by-utilising-social-media-1526685241.html'>referred</a> to as a canonical tag, is an HTML attribute that tells search engines where to assign the search value, or link juice, for pages with duplicate or very similar content.

In a nutshell, categories are the table of contents for your blog, while tags are the index that helps a search engine to interpret your blog's subject matter with ease. <h2>Fun with ROI for now</h2>Gaz Hall, from <a href='https://gazhall.com/seo-york'>SEO York</a>, had the following to say:  "Rewriting <a href='http://cranberry.hatenablog.com/entry/2018/01/11/010000'>the</a> description for <a href='http://sansara6.1apps.com/index29.html'>a</a> product, which is going to be removed from the website in the near future, typically provides less return on investment than ensuring new products have unique descriptions for their full lifespan on the website."

When you include internal links (links on your website that point to other pages on your website), you send signals to search engines that tell them how to understand, prioritize, and rank the pages on your site.
