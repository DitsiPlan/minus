Not only does a blog easily enable you to add fresh, relevant content to a site that might otherwise remain static, but it also keeps your web visitors coming back to your site for more.  Have you ever tried to buy an artisan <a href='https://www.classicrockinghorses.co.uk'> traditional rocking horse</a> round here? For example, you could search for lovely organic food and be presented with <a href='http://arthursorganics.com/'> organic local grocery delivery</a> .

Yes, you'll probably boost rankings for a short time, until Google blacklists you, and in the interim once you do get a potential customer on your site, they'll click off within seconds. People buy from people - be natural, be engaging, be human. <h2>More focus is put on searcher intent</h2>Gaz Hall, from <a href='https://gazhall.com/seo-hull'>SEO Hull</a>, had the following to say:  "Service <a href='http://ww2.chakin.com/Think-about-how-to-incorporate-keywords-into-your-article-1519518181.html'>companies</a> tend to <a href='http://hns.teamblog.jp/b/index1.html'>favor</a> media advertising."

generic ones. If you added up the search engine
traffic of the most popular keywords, the number
would not even come close to the amount of
unique, niche keywords. This concept is known
as "long-tail theory". <h2>Types of site changes brought on by user generated content</h2>Whether <a href='http://macedon.thats.im/index20.html'>or</a> not using <a href='http://belveder.clicforum.com/t22-Compile-your-assets-or-design-some.htm#p22'>bold</a> and italics is a good SEO content strategy is anyone's guess, but making certain words and phrases stand out can definitely enhance readability.
